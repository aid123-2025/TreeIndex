# TreeIndex

A concise, maintainable README for the TreeIndex repository.

> NOTE: This README is a template. Update the description, installation instructions, usage examples, and other sections to match the actual project implementation.

## Overview

TreeIndex is a project for building and querying tree-based indexes. It provides data structures and utilities to represent hierarchical data and perform efficient searches and traversals. Replace this section with a short project-specific description.

## Features

- Modular tree index implementation
- Query and traversal utilities
- (Placeholder) Pluggable backends and storage adapters

## Language & Tech

This repository may contain multiple languages. Update this section to reflect the actual languages and runtime requirements used by the project (for example: Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript, etc.).

## Getting started

Prerequisites

- Install required runtime(s) and tools (e.g. Go 1.20+, Rust toolchain, Python 3.10+, Node.js 18+, etc.)
- Git

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/aid123-2025/TreeIndex.git
cd TreeIndex
```

Build / install

Instructions vary by language/tooling. Common examples:

- Go

```
go build ./...
```

- Node / TypeScript

```
npm install
npm run build
```

- Python

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick start

Below are example commands — replace them with real usage examples from the project.

```
# Run a simple example (replace with actual command)
./bin/treeindex --input data/sample.json --query "name:foo"
```

Or import the library in code (pseudo-code):

```
from treeindex import TreeIndex
idx = TreeIndex()
idx.index(data)
results = idx.search("query")
```

## Configuration

If the project uses configuration files or environment variables, document them here.

## Tests

Run the test suite with the project's test command. Examples:

- Go: `go test ./...`
- Node: `npm test`
- Python: `pytest`
